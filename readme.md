## Key Insights for Presentation

> In my key insights for the p resentation, I focused on the bay Area bike share system users and their behavior, the user type & age, and the average trip duration, and the daily usage of the system, starting by introducing the distribution of the system users. Afterward, I used pointplot to show average trip duration(min) per day for Month. To finish, I introduced the effect of user type and age on long trip duration.
